			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			
			<div id="content">

				<p> My name is Erik. I like playing basketball and listening to music.
					I have some programming experience, mostly in HTML and CSS.
					I'm pretty interested in web design, so I want to use this class
					to help sharpen my skills in coding.
					My partner's name is Austin.
					He likes Metal Gear and I think he might
					be Solid Snake in disguise.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We needed to create a webpage in HTML, and then connect it to our CSS code and style it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had trouble correcting how my margin lined up with the rest of webpage. I couldn't fully fix it, as you can see. I also had trouble changing some fonts.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was overall pretty fun for me, it was interesting figuring out how things would look and working on the styling on my website. I think I put a lot of energy into trying to fix my errors, and coding the site overall.</p>
