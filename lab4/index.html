			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to get used to the process of Pseudocoding and apply it within the code editor.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wanted to list out my example using the ul tag, which I forgot how to utilize. I fixed this by taking a look at some examples on w3schools. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went well for me, it was nice to practice the process of Pseudocoding. I felt like it gave me a better understanding of how to think when coding. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

								<li>Get your dough, sauce, cheese and whatever toppings you like</li>
								<li>Start to preheat oven</li>
