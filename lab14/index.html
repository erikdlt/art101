				<p>This code is from Lab 7, and the issue was that I needed to add quotes to the nameArraySorted, so that it would stop printing out commas with the changed array. I didn't notice this issue before, so it was good that I caught it.</p>

				<p>This code and output is from Lab 2, where I couldn't figure out why my text border was moving off the page. Through debugging, I found that I had duplicate ids named "content", which were breaking the code. Once I caught this, I gave them different names and created a new css section to style the new id I made. This corrected the issue.</p>
